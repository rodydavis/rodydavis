```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "App Release Automator by @rodydavis"

action="$1"
red=`tput setaf 1`
green=`tput setaf 2`
reset=`tput sgr0`

if [ ${action} = "build" ]; then

    echo "${green}Generating built files.. ${reset}"
    flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
    flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

    pub global activate pubspec_version
    git commit -a -m "Build $(pubver bump patch)"
    
    echo "${green}Building Project...${reset}"
    find . -name "*-e" -type f -delete
    flutter format .
    flutter clean

    echo "${green}Project Size: $(find . -name "*.dart" | xargs cat | wc -c)${reset}"

    echo "${green}Building APK...${reset}"
    flutter build apk

    echo "${green}Builing IPA..${reset}"
    cd ./ios && pod install && pod repo update && cd ..
    flutter build ios

    git commit -a -m "Project Rebuilt"


elif [ ${action} = "beta" ]; then

    echo "${green}Generating built files..${reset}"
    flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
    flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

    pub global activate pubspec_version
    git commit -a -m "Beta $(pubver bump patch)"
    
    echo "${green}Building Project...${reset}"

    git commit -a -m "Sent to Beta"


elif [ ${action} = "release" ]; then

    echo "${green}Generating built files..${reset}"
    flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
    flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

    echo "${green}Building APK...${reset}"
    flutter build apk

    echo "${green}Sending Android to Production...${reset}"
    cd ./android && fastlane release && cd ..

    echo "${green}Builing IPA..${reset}"
    flutter build ios

    echo "${green}Sending iOS to Production...${reset}"
    cd ./ios && fastlane release && cd ..

    git commit -a -m "Sent to Production"

Needed:
- Fastlane setup in each directory

- Git Project in VCS

Steps to Run:

1. Download this file and put it at the root level of your flutter project
2. Open the terminal and navigate to your project location
3. Enter this command: ` chmod +x release.sh`
