<p>Below are the steps to get your plugin running. You can also find instructions at:<p><a href=https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/ >https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/</a><p>This plugin template uses Typescript and NPM, two standard tools in creating JavaScript applications.<p>First, download Node.js which comes with NPM. This will allow you to install TypeScript and other<br>libraries. You can find the download link here:<p><a href=https://nodejs.org/en/download/ >https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a><p>Next, install TypeScript using the command:<p>npm install -g typescript<p>Finally, in the directory of your plugin, get the latest type definitions for the plugin API by running:<p>npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings<p>If you are familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript will look very familiar. In fact, valid JavaScript code<br>is already valid Typescript code.<p>TypeScript adds type annotations to variables. This allows code editors such as Visual Studio Code<br>to provide information about the Figma API while you are writing code, as well as help catch bugs<br>you previously didn't notice.<p>For more information, visit <a href=https://www.typescriptlang.org/ >https://www.typescriptlang.org/</a><p>Using TypeScript requires a compiler to convert TypeScript (code.ts) into JavaScript (code.js)<br>for the browser to run.<p>We recommend writing TypeScript code using Visual Studio code:<ol><li>Download Visual Studio Code if you haven't already: <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/ >https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>.<li>Open this directory in Visual Studio Code.<li>Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Run the "Terminal > Run Build Task..." menu item,<br>then select "tsc: watch - tsconfig.json". You will have to do this again every time<br>you reopen Visual Studio Code.</ol><p>That's it! Visual Studio Code will regenerate the JavaScript file every time you save.
