        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Rody Davis and I grew up in Alabama but currently live and work in San Francisco. Growing up, I was always taking apart every device I had and recreating it to figure it out and how it worked then sometimes making something new. I always wanted to be an inventor growing up, and I was always sketching out designs and building prototypes and stuffing them in a box. In high school I was in marching band on the drumline and worked many jobs. When I went to Florida College there was a job I though I always wanted to do, which was being the Audio Visual Technician. After working that job for almost five years I joined a small startup where I managed the video department and later became the System Administrator.</p>
        <p>The job was not what I wanted however, so I slowly but steadily taught my self mobile development. I created my first app and released it into the AppStore, “The Pitch Pipe”, and it quickly gained traction as it fulfilled a need in the market being undeserved. I then was able to get a job a professional mobile developer and now I am in charge of the mobile department creating both Android and iOS apps.</p>
        <p>Something that dawned on me recently is that I am doing my dream job, I always wanted to be an inventor and now I am. It may not involve physical products but the rules still apply. I get to create products from pure imagination and bring them to market.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to what the future will bring and I’m excited about all the new technologies coming up. All the apps I create try to reflect me learning and trying to perfect different markets and technologies for mobile. We spend a majority of our lives on our smart phones, there is now more than ever a need for high quality and functioning apps. Never stop learning and trying to be better.</p>
